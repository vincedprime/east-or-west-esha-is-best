Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears.
Do you have a name, or can I call you mine?
Are you a Wi-Fi signal? Because I’m feeling a strong connection.
Is your name Google? Because you have everything I’ve been searching for.
Are you a time traveler? Because I see you in my future.
